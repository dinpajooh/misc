The analysis of trajectories of the solvated Kihara solute with RHS of 10 Ang  (epsilon=3.7 kJ/mol, sigma=3.0 Ang).
The solvent is TIP3P water model.


A sample lammps trajectory (dump.cords_xyz.dat) is available in the LAMMPS-ANLY directory. 
Analysing such trajectory files as described in LAMMPS-ANLY generates Field_pot.dat file, which 
contains the field (E) and electrostatic potential (phi) at the center of KH solute:

Format of Field_pot.dat file:
first column: atom number
second column: atom type
thrid column:  Ex in kcal/mol/e/Ang
fourth column: Ey in kcal/mol/e/Ang
fifth column:  Ez in kcal/mol/e/Ang
sixth column:  0.5 of electrostaic potential in kcal/mol/e

All the parameters for this analysis including the particle-particle particle-mesh solver 
for the electrostaic interactions can be found in in.anly file in LAMMPS-ANLY directory.

More details about LAMMPS-ANALYSIS calculations can be found in the LAMMPS-ANLY directory.
