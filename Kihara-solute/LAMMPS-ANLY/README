This directory contains the analysis LAMMPS script that is used to 
get the field and electrostatics potential at the center of KH solute.

LAMMPS (2 Jul 2021) version was used for this analysis.

The analysis LAMMPS script is called in.anly, where one can find all the parameters for the analysis.

Running anly.sh generates dump.force0kh.dat containing the field and electrostatics potential.
Field_pot.dat in the above directory is generated after getting the related lines from the dump.force0kh.dat file.


Format of dump.force0kh.dat for the related lines is:
first column: atom number
second column: atom type
thrid column:  Ex in kcal/mol/e/Ang
fourth column: Ey in kcal/mol/e/Ang
fifth column:  Ez in kcal/mol/e/Ang
sixth column:  0.5 of electrostaic potential in kcal/mol/e
